       <h2>Controversy of Marlboro in Car Advertising</h2>
       <p> The controversy surrounding Marlboro in car advertising, especially Formula 1, reached a peak with the Ferrari Barcode Livery Scandel. Marlboro, had a long-standing sponsorship with Ferrari dating back to the mid 1980s. However, as tobacco advertising became increasingly restricted in sports, especially in the early 2000s, regulations forced the bran into finding creative way to continue advertising. With Ferrari adopting a barcode like pattern on their cars in place of the Marlboro logo, that at high speeds would blur into the logo livery of Marboloro. This subliminal advertising was controversial bringing up the same issues of public health when advertising of tobacco is concered, Ferrari eventually buckled under pressure of health concerns unlike decades before hand, where the Marboloro brand once stood a part of American Culture.  </p>
